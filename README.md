# timeline-example

## TODO

- [ ] Show a timeline (with time)
- [ ] make a `div` overlay that registers the mouse position and shows on top of the timeline

## How is it built?

Timeline:

- CSS grid

The mouse tracking:

- register tracking on the overlay rather than on the browser:
  - allows the user to put the timeline to a specific place, then move the pointer away from the timeline to read/interact with the content panel
